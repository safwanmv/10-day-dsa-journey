## 🚀 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

This project provides an efficient JavaScript solution to the **"Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array"** problem, commonly found in technical interviews and coding platforms like LeetCode.

---

### 🧠 Problem Description

Given an **integer array sorted in non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only once. Return the number of unique elements `k`.

The first `k` elements of the modified array should contain the unique elements in the same relative order. Elements beyond `k` are not important.

---

### ✅ Example

**Input:**
`[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

**Output:**

* `k = 5`
* Modified array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, _]`

---

### 🔧 Solution Highlights

* ✅ Uses **in-place two-pointer technique**
* ✅ No extra space required (`O(1)` space complexity)
* ✅ Linear time complexity `O(n)`
* ✅ Clean and readable arrow function

---

### 📁 Files Included

* `removeDuplicates.js` – JavaScript implementation of the solution

---

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/safwanmv/remove-duplicates-array.git
   cd remove-duplicates-array
   ```
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   node removeDuplicates.js
   ```
